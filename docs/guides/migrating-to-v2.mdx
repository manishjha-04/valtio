# How to Migrate to v2 from v1

## Changes in v2

React 19 officially introduces the `use` hook to handle promises.
Valtio v1 internally handled promises, which is no longer recommended.
In Valtio v2, promises are not handled internally,
and developers should explicitly use the `use` hook to manage promises.

Note: If you are still using React 18, you can use [the `use` hook shim](https://github.com/dai-shi/react18-use).

Valtio v2 also introduces several changes in its design choices:

First, the behavior of `proxy(obj)` has changed. In v1, it was a pure function and deeply copied `obj`. In v2, it is an impure function and deeply modifies `obj`. Generally, reusing `obj` is not recommended, and if you have followed this convention, nothing will break.

Second, the behavior of `useSnapshot()` has been altered. Although it is a subtle change, it is less optimized to ensure compatibility with `useMemo` and the upcoming React compiler. The change may lead to extra re-renders in some edge cases, but it might not be noticeable.

Other notable changes to keep things updated and fresh include:

- Removal of all deprecated features
- Requirement of React version 18 and above
- Requirement of TypeScript version 4.5 and above
- The build target updated to ES2018

## Codemods

To assist with the upgrade, a set of codemods is available to automatically update your codebase from Valtio v1. These codemods automate common code transformations to streamline the migration process.

Run all codemods listed in this guide with the Valtio v2 codemod recipe:

  ```bash     
  npx codemod valtio/v2/migration-recipe
  ```

This will run the following codemods:
 - `valtio/v2/use-snapshot-migration`
 - `valtio/v2/deep-clone-proxy-objects`

Each of these codemods automates the changes listed in this migration guide.
For a complete list of available Valtio codemods and further details, 
see the [codemod registry](https://codemod.com/registry?q=valtio).

## Migration for breaking changes

### Resolving promises

```js
// v1
import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ data: fetch(...).then((res) => res.json()) })

const Component = () => {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state)
  return <>{JSON.stringify(snap.data)}</>
}
```

```js
// v2
import { use } from 'react'
import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ data: fetch(...).then((res) => res.json()) })

const Component = () => {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state)
  return <>{JSON.stringify(use(snap.data))}</>
  // If `data` is not an object, you can directly embed it in JSX.
  // return <>{snap.data}</>
}
```
**Codemod** for using Resolving promises
```bash
  npx codemod valtio/v2/use-snapshot-migration
```
### Impure `proxy(obj)`

```js
// v1
import { proxy } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ count: 1, obj: { text: 'hi' } })
state.obj = { text: 'hello' }
```

```js
// v2
import { proxy } from 'valtio'
import { deepClone } from 'valtio/utils'

const state = proxy(deepClone({ count: 1, obj: { text: 'hi' } }))
state.obj = deepClone({ text: 'hello' })
```

Note that `deepClone` is unnecessary unless you are reusing the object.
It is generally recommended to avoid reusing the object.

**Codemod** for Proxy Objects
```bash
  npx codemod valtio/v2/deep-clone-proxy-objects
```
